Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant VRChat the licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Platform is in compliance with any contractual obligations you have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Platform that may be claimed by your label. Finally, if you wish to perform a cover song and Post it, you are responsible for recuring all rights in and to the underlying musical work before Posting your recording or performance of that musical work.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">8.6. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Deleting User Content</span>. Where permitted by functionality within the Platform, you may delete copies or instances of your User Content that you have uploaded through the normal functionality of the Platform. If you delete your User Content through use of that functionality, the licenses granted by you in this Section 8 to your User Content terminate as described in this Section 8.6 with respect to the particular copies or instances of your User Content that you have deleted. The termination of the licenses does not apply to any copies or instances of the same User Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Platform, including those that may be displayed elsewhere or that may be stored by other Users to whom you have transferred or sold copies. The licenses under this Section 8 that you have granted to your User Content that you delete through the Platform will survive termination solely to allow VRChat to: (a) retain server copies of particular instances of your User Content, including copies stored in connection with back-up, debugging, and testing procedures; and (b) enable the exercise of the licenses granted in this Section 8 for any other copies or instances of the same User Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Platform, including those that may be displayed elsewhere or that exist in other Users’ account inventories.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">8.7. <span style="text-decoration:underline">User Content Disclaimer</span>. We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other Users may Post and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. VRChat may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms, is alleged to violate the rights of third parties, or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that, when using the Platform, you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Most User Content, including worlds and avatars, available through VRChat is created by other Users or third parties, and VRChat does not control or actively monitor the content or technical features of individual worlds, avatars, or other User Content. You understand that any world you enter is at your own risk. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against VRChat with respect to User Content. We expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Content. If notified by a User or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may (but are under no obligation to) investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">8.8. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Groups Generally</span>. The Platform enables Users to create and join “groups” comprised of other Users (“<strong>Groups</strong>”). The individual or entity who created the Group will be deemed the owner of the Group for all purposes (the “<strong>Group Owner</strong>"). The Group Owner may designate (in that person’s sole discretion) to make a different person the new Group Owner (in such case the new owner shall be considered the Group Owner). If the Group Owner’s User Account is terminated pursuant to these Terms, VRChat may, in its sole discretion, determine who shall be designated the rightful person to be made the new Group Owner of such Group (and that User shall be considered the Group Owner); provided, however, that nothing will obligate VRChat to designate a new Group Owner if VRChat in its sole discretion determines to terminate a Group.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">8.9. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Groups and User Content</span>. </p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">a. By participating in a Group, you hereby grant the Group Owner, as such Group Owner may change over time, the sole and exclusive authority to act on your behalf to authorize VRChat to use any User Content created by or uploaded to the Group as set forth in these Terms, the <a href="legal/economy.html">Creator Economy Program Rules</a> (“<strong>CE Rules</strong>”), or pursuant to any other agreement entered into between the Group Owner and VRChat. A Group Owner and the members of a Group may separately agree upon how the Group Owner may exercise the authority granted to such Group Owner in these Terms or how the members of a Group may allocate amongst themselves any payments that may be made to the Group Owner for any activities undertaken or User Content created by or uploaded to the Group. In any event, VRChat will make any payments due for any activities undertaken by the Group or User Content created by or uploaded to the Group solely to the applicable Group Owner.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">b. You hereby waive any claims that you may have against VRChat for any payments made to a Group Owner by VRChat, and you agree to seek recovery of any payments due to you solely from the applicable Group Owner. Except as may be provided by law, any duty of accounting between a Group Owner and members of such Group will arise solely pursuant to any written agreements among the Group Owner and the members of such Group, and VRChat will not be bound by any such agreements.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">9.&nbsp;User Content</h4><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">9.1. <span style="text-decoration:underline">VRChat Credits</span>. </p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">a. <span style="text-decoration:underline">License to Use</span>. We, in our sole discretion, may grant certain Users a limited license to use our official Platform currency, VRChat Credits (“<strong>Credits</strong>”), in the applicable portions of the Platform (the “<strong>VRC Creator Economy</strong>”). If we allow you to use Credits, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, revocable, personal, limited, non-transferable (except as specifically set out otherwise in these Terms) right and license to use Credits only: (i) in connection with the Platform; (ii) for your individual, personal, entertainment; and (iii) subject to these Terms.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">b. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Termination of License</span>. We may terminate your limited license to use Credits at any time if: (i) you violate these Terms or any other VRChat policies; (ii) we suspend, ban, or delete your account; (iii) we terminate these Terms; or (iv) we stop offering the Platform.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">c. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Ways to Acquire Credits</span>. Credits may be acquired: (i) by purchasing them directly from us or through the third-party markets that we authorize to sell Credits; (ii) by receiving them from other Users, if and to the extent permitted by us; (iii) by receiving them from VRChat after your Seller Content (defined below) has been sold to a purchaser; or (iv) by acquiring them through other such other methods or promotions that we may offer from time to time. We will credit your User Account for any Credits purchased, received, or acquired by you unless we terminate your license to such Credits as described in Section 9.1(b).</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">d. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Purchase and Transfer Limits</span>. Users may be subject to daily purchase limits as may be implemented or changed by VRChat in its sole discretion from time to time, and may not in any event purchase more than $10,000 in Credits on any one calendar day. You may not transfer, assign, sell, gift, exchange, trade, convert, lease, sublicense, rent, or distribute Credits except through the Platform as expressly permitted by VRChat. Any disposition or attempted disposition of Credits in violation of these Terms may be voided and result in the immediate termination of your User Account and/or your license to use Credits. Except as expressly authorized by VRChat, third-party services may not be used to sell, exchange, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Credits. We do not assume any responsibility for, and will not support, any such transactions.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">e. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Credits Not Redeemable or Exchangeable</span>. Credits do not: (i) have any inherent value in real, fiat currency; (ii) act as a substitute for real currency; or (iii) earn interest. Credits are not redeemable or exchangeable for real currency, monetary value, or convertible virtual currency from us or any third party, except as expressly provided in these Terms or as otherwise required by applicable law. Transactions involving the exchange of Credits for Seller Content (as defined below) or other virtual items or services on the Platform are not legally enforceable, may not form the basis of any private right of action against VRChat or any third party, and are governed solely by VRChat in its sole discretion and these Terms.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">f. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Final Payment</span>. All payments that you make for Credits, whether to VRChat or a third-party payment processor, are final and not refundable or exchangeable, except as required by applicable law. </p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">g. <span style="text-decoration:underline">No Further Obligations</span>. Neither VRChat nor any third party has any obligation to exchange Credits for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency, except as expressly provided in these Terms or otherwise required by applicable law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, VRChat, in its sole discretion, may impose limits on Credits, including, but not limited to, the amount that may be acquired, earned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of at any time.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">h. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Reservation of Rights</span>. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law and subject to the limited licenses granted to you in these Terms, VRChat has and retains all rights in and to Credits. This includes the right to modify, revoke, or terminate your license to use VRChat without notice, payment, or liability to you. VRChat makes no guarantees or warranties regarding Credits or their availability or value. VRChat makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of Credits or the availability or supply thereof.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">9.2. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Creators and VRChat Credit Transactions</span>. </p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">a. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Using Credits</span>. VRChat may enable certain Users to purchase Credits, maintain a balance of Credits, pay Credits for Seller Content (as defined below), and receive Credits as compensation for selling Seller Content as described in this Section 9.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">b. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Creators</span>. Any User who Posts User Content to the Platform shall be considered a “<strong>Creator</strong>.”</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">c. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Sellers</span>. VRChat may enable certain Creators to list User Content that they have created for sale to other Users. Creators who list their User Content for sale and meet the requirements in these Terms and the CE Rules will be considered “<strong>Sellers</strong>”. In order to become a Seller, a Creator must complete an onboarding process and receive approval from VRChat. VRChat may utilize a third-party partner to: (i) operate the onboarding process; (ii) determine if a User has approval to become a Seller; and (iii) facilitate Payouts (as defined below) (each such partner a “<strong>CE Partner</strong>”). If VRChat works with a CE Partner, Creators may be required to utilize the CE Partner’s interface and provide information to the CE Partner to obtain approval to become a Seller. More details about the requirements to receive approval to become a Seller are listed in the CE Rules.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">d. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Selling User Content</span>. VRChat may provide mechanisms on the Platform for Sellers to sell their digital goods, experiences, services, performances, subscriptions (including Paid Roles (as defined below)), or other User Content created or offered by such Seller (“<strong>Seller Content</strong>”). When another User elects to purchase such Seller Content through these mechanisms, VRChat will: (i) deduct the required number of Credits from the purchaser’s account; (ii) grant the purchaser a sub-license to the Seller Content that will enable the purchaser to access and use such Seller Content; and (iii) credit the Seller’s account with a number of Credits equal to the Credits paid by the purchaser minus any Transaction Fees (defined below and elaborated on in the CE Rules). All Seller Content that is “sold” or “purchased” under these Terms is licensed to the applicable purchaser as described in this Section 9.2(d).</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">e. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Earned Credits and Payout Requests</span>. Credits received by a Seller when Seller Content is purchased (“<strong>Earned Credits</strong>”) may be: (i) eligible to be exchanged for U.S. dollars at the then-current exchange rate set by VRChat (“<strong>Payout</strong>”), subject to VRChat’s approval of a payout request submitted by the Seller (“<strong>Payout Request</strong>”) and in compliance with these Terms and the CE Rules; or (ii) used to purchase Seller Content from another User within the Platform. If a Seller chooses to spend Earned Credits in the Platform, the Earned Credits will be deducted from the Seller’s account and therefore will not be eligible for a Payout Request at any future point.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">f. <span style="text-decoration:underline">VRChat Credit Transactions</span>. You may only use Credits as payment within the Platform as permitted by VRChat. All transactions in Credits will be governed by these Terms. Each Seller, and not VRChat, is solely responsible for any Seller Content. VRChat makes no guarantee that the Seller Content will be available or function in any manner.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">g. Group Roles.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">(i) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Paid Roles</span>. VRChat may permit Sellers to create paid-only roles within Groups in exchange for Credits (“<strong>Paid Roles</strong>”). Having a Paid Role may grant you certain privileges or access to certain Seller Content, as determined by the applicable Seller (“<strong>Role Benefits</strong>”). A Seller may update the Role Benefits in their sole discretion. While we attempt to ensure that every Seller complies with these Terms, the CE Rules, the Community Guidelines, and all other applicable policies, VRChat is ultimately not responsible for, and makes no representation or guarantee with respect to any claims or promises made by the Seller in connection with a Paid Role or the Role Benefits. If you have a complaint or concern with a Paid Role, Role Benefits, or the actions of any Seller, please contact VRChat User Support at <a href="https://vrch.at/support" target="_blank">https://vrch.at/support</a>.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">(ii) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tiered Roles</span>. Sellers may offer different tiers of Paid Roles, and each tier may come with different Role Benefits. If you change your Paid Role’s tier, your Role Benefits will change to correspond to your new Paid Role’s tier, and you may lose Role Benefits associated with your previous Paid Role’s tier.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">(iii) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Time-Limited Roles</span>. Paid Roles may be time-limited, and you may be required to pay Credits on a regular basis to maintain your Paid Role. The timing and amount of each payment depends on the settings selected by the applicable Seller, and you may view those details through the Platform prior to making your initial payment for the Paid Role. VRChat may provide you with the option to make these payments automatically. If we do so, VRChat will automatically deduct the required number of Credits from your account on each recurring payment date. If you do not have the required number of Credits in your account at the time the payment is due, you may lose your Paid Role.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">(iv) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pre-Paid Roles</span>. The Platform may permit you to pre-pay for a Paid Role for a certain period of time (“<strong>Stacked Purchase</strong>”). In this case, you will pay the Credits up front for the entire period that you would like to purchase the Paid Role.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">(v) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Cancellation</span>. If you cancel your Paid Role or you do not continue to pay for the Paid Role after your Stacked Purchase expires, you may lose your Role Benefits. You may cancel future payments for Paid Roles through the Platform or by contacting VRChat User Support, and your Paid Role will terminate on the day your next payment would have been due or made. It is possible that: (x) VRChat removes a Seller offering a Paid Role from the Platform or revokes that Seller’s right to participate in the VRC Creator Economy; (y) a Seller decides to discontinue offering your Paid Role; or (z) a Seller blocks you from the Group or from purchasing their Paid Roles. In each of those cases, VRChat will not charge you for future payments for such Paid Roles and will refund a portion of your pre-paid Credits for Stacked Purchases, pro-rated on a monthly basis to reflect the portion of your Stacked Purchase that was unreceived.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">h. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Transaction Fees Generally</span>. We may charge service, transaction, or other fees in connection with any transaction conducted with Credits for our role in providing the Platform, maintaining the VRC Creator Economy, facilitating such transactions within the Platform, and offering other services relating to the Platform and the VRC Creator Economy (“<strong>Transaction Fees</strong>”). VRChat may update the Transaction Fees at any time for any reason but will provide Users with reasonable notice before any update takes effect. You can see the current Transaction Fees in the CE Rules.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">i. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Disputes</span>. We have an interest in making sure that the Platform provides a good experience for all involved and reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to intervene to attempt to mitigate or resolve disputes among Users relating to VRChat Credit transactions. To escalate a problem to us, please contact our Customer Service Department by submitting a ticket at <a href="https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank">https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us</a>. If we decide intervention is appropriate, you understand and agree that our decision, which may include reallocating, refunding, or crediting Credits from one User to another in our sole discretion is final. We may freeze the amount of Credits in controversy in your User Account until VRChat determines that the dispute is resolved, and if our decision includes the reallocation, refund, or crediting of Credits paid to you by another User and you do not have a sufficient balance of Credits in your User Account, we reserve the right to reduce accordingly any future payments to you of Credits. If you are involved in any such dispute, you agree to work with us in a good faith and prompt manner to resolve the dispute.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">9.3. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Reservation of Rights</span>. We, in our sole discretion, have the absolute right to manage, modify, suspend, revoke, and terminate the VRC Creator Economy without notice, refund, compensation, or liability to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. If you do anything related to the Platform that is against the law or otherwise in violation of these Terms, the Community Guidelines, the CE Rules, or any of our other policies, we reserve the right to deny, suspend, or terminate your access to the VRC Creator Economy and void any pending transaction thereunder.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">9.4. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Additional CE Partner Terms</span>.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">a. Certain features of the Platform relating to Credits may be provided through third-party services integrated into the Platform, including features (the “<strong>Tilia Service</strong>”) currently provided by the CE Partner Tilia LLC (“<strong>Tilia</strong>”). In order to access and use the Tilia Service, you must establish and maintain an active and valid user account with Tilia, and accept and agree to Tilia’s Terms of Service available at <a href="https://www.tilia.io/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank">https://www.tilia.io/legal/terms-of-service</a> (or any successor URL designated by Tilia) and Privacy Policy available at <a href="https://www.tilia.io/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.tilia.io/legal/privacy-policy</a> (or any successor URL designated by Tilia), which shall govern your use of the Tilia Service. The Tilia Service is not under our control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for your use of the Tilia Service, so please review Tilia’s terms carefully. In order to use certain features of the Tilia Service, you may also be required to establish and maintain active and valid user accounts with Tilia’s third party service providers.</p><p style="margin-left:80px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">b. VRCHAT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE TILIA SERVICE AND, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING THE TILIA SERVICE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AS BETWEEN VRCHAT AND YOU, (i) YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE TILIA SERVICE, YOUR DEALING WITH TILIA, AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE TILIA SERVICE, AND (ii) YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TILIA SERVICE), OR THE LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE TILIA SERVICE OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THAT MATERIAL OR CONTENT THEREFROM.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">10. Payments</h4><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">10.1. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Payments Generally</span>. Access to the Platform, or to certain features of the Platform, may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise stated, all fees or other amounts specified in these Terms or on the Platform are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. Purchases made through third-party markets, such as Steam and Oculus, may be governed by additional terms provided by such third-party markets. If VRChat changes the fees for any part of the Platform, including by adding additional fees or charges, VRChat will provide you with advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, VRChat may discontinue providing the Platform or the applicable portion of the Platform to you. VRChat or its third-party payment processors will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. You authorize VRChat and its third-party payment processors to charge all sums as described in these Terms to that payment method. If you pay any fees with a credit card, VRChat or its third-party payment processors may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. If you use the Platform to update or cancel any existing authorized payment, it may take up to 10 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">10.2. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Subscription Service</span>. Certain premium features on the Platform may be made available through purchase of a subscription (“<strong>Subscription Service</strong>”). Subscription Services involve automatically recurring payments for periodic charges and may be purchased through a third-party market. If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize VRChat (or the applicable third-party market) to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your Account, all accrued sums for your subscription to the Subscription Service on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you first purchase a subscription to a Subscription Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your Account (such period, the “<strong>Initial Subscription Period</strong>”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “<strong>Subscription Period</strong>”). Your Account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. </p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">Your subscription to the Subscription Service will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription to a Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your Account. We (or the applicable third-party market) will bill the periodic subscription fee to the payment method you provide during purchase (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information).</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">We may suspend or terminate access to a Subscription Service for any Account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for any Subscription Service, a delinquent Account may be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal subscription fee is due, then VRChat reserves the right to suspend your Account and your access to the Platform without any liability to you. If your Account is terminated or suspended for violation of these Terms, any ongoing Subscription Service associated with the Account may be canceled and no refund will be provided for any remaining portion of your then-current Subscription Period(s).</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">10.3 <span style="text-decoration:underline">Payments for Subscription Services are non-refundable</span>. If you have activated a Subscription Service through a thirdparty market, you may cancel your subscription to that Subscription Service through the third-party market’s account settings or other procedures established by that third-party market.

You may not use any part of the Platform for any commercial uses or other uses outside the scope of what is expressly permitted in these Terms without entering into a separate written agreement with VRChat that expressly allows that expanded use (such an agreement, a “<strong>Commercial Use Agreement</strong>”). Unless, and solely to the extent that, such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law or applicable third-party license, you may not, and may not permit any third party to: (a) decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise access or attempt to access the source code for any portion of the Platform, or make or attempt to make any modification to any portion of the Platform (other than modifications of the type described in the applicable User documentation made available to you by VRChat) or (b) interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Platform, including any security, or access control mechanism.

These Terms (which includes the Copyright Policy, the Privacy Policy, and, if applicable, the SDK License, Community Guidelines, Brand Guidelines, CE Rules, any Additional Terms, any Additional Terms, and any Commercial Use Agreement between you and VRChat (collectively, the “<strong>Ancillary Agreements</strong>”)) is the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and VRChat regarding your use of the Platform.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">26.3.  Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">26.4.  You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your User Content, at any time without notice or consent.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">26.5.  The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">26.6.  For purposes of these Terms, (a) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”; (b) the words “such as”, “for example” “e.g.” and any derivatives of those words will mean by way of example and the items that follow these words will not be deemed an exhaustive list; (c) the word “or” is used in the inclusive sense of “and/or” and the terms “or,” “any,” and “either” are not exclusive; (d) the words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereto” and “hereunder” refer to this Agreement as a whole; (e) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice-versa; and (f) whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </h4><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.1. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Generally</span>.  In the interest of resolving disputes between you and VRChat in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and VRChat agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Platform, and communications from us will be resolved by binding confidential arbitration in English. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, the Platform, and communications from us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND VRCHAT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.2.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Exceptions</span>.  Despite the provisions of Section 27.1, nothing in this will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.3. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Opt-Out</span>.  If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 27 within 30 days after the date that you agree to this by sending a letter to VRChat Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 548 Market St., #93053 San Francisco, CA, 94104-5401, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account on the Platform, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>”). Once VRChat receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 27 will be void and any action arising out of this will be resolved as set forth in Section 25. The remaining provisions of this will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.4.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Arbitrator</span>.  Any arbitration between you and VRChat will: (a) be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act; (b) be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), as modified by this; (c) be administered by the AAA; and (d) if an arbitration hearing is held, take place at a mutually-agreed location in San Francisco County, California. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting VRChat. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.5. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Notice; Process</span>  </p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">a. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). VRChat’s address for Notice is: VRChat Inc., 548 Market St, #93053 San Francisco, CA, 94104-5401. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”).</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">b. The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or VRChat may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or VRChat must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  </p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">c. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, VRChat will pay you the highest of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by VRChat in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; and (iii) $1,000.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.6  <span style="text-decoration:underline">Fees</span>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, VRChat will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in the county and state of your residence, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence or billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse VRChat for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.7.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Decision</span>. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.8.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">No Class Actions</span>.  YOU AND VRCHAT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Furthermore, unless both you and VRChat agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.9.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</span>. If VRChat makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to VRChat’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to VRChat’s address for Notice, in which case your Account with VRChat will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p><p style="margin-left:40px;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">27.10.<strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Enforceability</span>.  If Section 27.8 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 27 is found to be unenforceable, or if VRChat receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 25 will govern any action arising out of or related to this.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">28.
